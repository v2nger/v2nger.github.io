# Plannio

**Manage group shopping costs with ease.**

Plannio is a mobile application that helps groups
fairly and clearly split the cost of a shared shopping,
even when one person completes the purchase.

Collect orders, do the shopping,
enter the receipt — Plannio calculates the per-person cost.

## How does it work?

1. Create an organization and let participants submit their orders  
2. The organizer completes the shopping and enters the receipt details  
3. Plannio automatically calculates the per-person settlement  

All participants can review the calculation
and confirm their payable or receivable amounts.

## Why Plannio?

- Fairly distribute shared expenses  
- Keep calculations transparent for everyone
